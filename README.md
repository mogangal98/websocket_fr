This code connects to the Binance WebSocket to gather funding rate data for over 
200+ cryptocurrency pairs in real-time. It saves this data into a MySQL database at 
1-minute intervals. The collected data is used in other projects where funding rate 
information is needed for further processing or analysis.

Note:
This is a simplified version of the original code provided for 
demonstration purposes on GitHub. Sensitive information, such as database credentials
and other specific details, has been removed or modified.
